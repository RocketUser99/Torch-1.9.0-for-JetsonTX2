# Torch-1.9.0-for-JetsonTX2

I built this PyTorch pip wheel installers for **Jetson TX2** for a senior design projet at UC Davis. As I currently don't have access to the board anymore, I can't verify the specific version of **JetPack 4** version on the TX2 board but the Python build for this PyTorch pip wheel is 3.8. If you need something else then follow this [official guide](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/72048)
